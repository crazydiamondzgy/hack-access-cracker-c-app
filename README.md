this is a very old stuff wrote in 2005, I backup it to Github now. if there is something useful to you, just enjoy it!
When you set a password in Access 95/97 database, the password is encrypted with simple XOR operation. 

CAUTION
=======
This small utility instantly recovers the database password of 
Microsoft Access files (mdb files)
It works only with Access 95 or 97.
